### Script to automate adding Salary slip each month

- Head over to you app script console.
- Paste the code in `main.gs`
- Paste values in `mails` and `mailNameMapping` accordingly.
- Set recurring triggers on the `myfunction` on expected date + 1 of each month. (eg. if expected date of salary slip is 1st, set up trigger for 2nd).
- No need to remember adding slip each day.
